# Visualize your life! 
## *(actually how much life left you have)*

[Demo of the app](https://pixelvoxelfr.github.io/lifevisualizer/)

Time flies and it's sometimes interesting to take a step back on your life to see how much you've lived so far and how much you have left. With this little app, fill in your birthdate, sex and country of residency to get an estimae of your life expectancy.
You'll then be able to visualize your life in years, months or days lived and left to live.

## But why ? That's so depressing !
I'll be honest it kind of is...

But I believe it's better to face the fact that eventually all life comes to an end in order to get your a*s off the couch and enjoy every moment you have instead of wasting it away doom scrolling.
Things of immeasurable value might become obvious to you when presenting it this way:
- How many Christmases will you celebrate with your parents before they pass away ?
- How long have you left with your children before you do ?
- How many years have you wasted in a job that doesn't fulfill you ?

**I wish you a happy and fulfilled life and to enjoy every bit of it!**
